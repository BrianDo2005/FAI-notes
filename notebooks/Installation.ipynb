    "5. Run `conda env update`. If you are installing for only cpu, do `conda env update -f environment-cpu.yml`. This creates a conda environment with the name `fastai`. If you want to use a different name you could either run `conda env update -n env_name` replacing `env_name` with whatever name you want.\n",

For example you could do: `ssh -L 8888:localhost:8888 paperspace@ip-add`. This forwards the port 8888 on server side to your localmachine. For me doing this in itself solved the problem. Also note, you might need to add `-4` option with `ssh` in case you get any error in binding the port.\n",

    "    + Second (and the not recommended way) is to do `c.NotebookApp.disable_check_xsrf = True` in jupyter_notebook_config.py. (Taken from @kylebarron's solution). The jupyter_notebook_config.py is located inside .jupyter directory which is located inside `$HOME`. If the .jupyter folder does not contain a jupyter_notebook_config.py file, you need to generate it with `jupyter notebook --generate-config`. What this essentially does is removes the `_xsrf` check from the browser. "
